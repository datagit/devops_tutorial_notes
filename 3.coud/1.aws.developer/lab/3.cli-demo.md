AWS CLI Exam Tips
  Least privilege
    Always give your users the minimum amount of access required to do their job.
  User groups
    Create AIM groups and assign your users to groups
    Groups permissions are assigned using AIM policy document.
    Your users automatically inherit the permissions of the group.
  Secret Access Key
    You will only see this once! if you lose it, you can delete the access key ID and secret access key and generate them.
    You will need to run <aws configure> again.
  Don't share your key pairs
    Each developer should have their own access key ID and secret key ID just like passwords, they should not be shared

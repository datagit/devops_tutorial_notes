Hello, Cloud Gurus and welcome to this lecture
which is going to introduce CloudWatch.
And Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service
that allows you to monitor the health and performance
of your AWS resources as well as the applications
that you run on AWS, and in your own datacenter.
So what can CloudWatch monitor?
Well, pretty much everything.
So in terms of compute, it can monitor EC2 instances,
Auto Scaling groups, Elastic Load Balancers
Route53 health checks, and Lambda.
In terms of storage and content delivery,
It covers EBS volumes, Storage Gateway, and CloudFront.
And for databases and analytics,
it can monitor DynamoDB tables, ElastiCache nodes,
RDS instances, Redshift, and Elastic Map Reduce,
which is the AWS big data offering.
And in addition to all of that it can also monitor
SNS topics, SQS queues, API Gateway,
and it can even monitor your estimated AWS monthly charges.
So this is what you get out of the box with CloudWatch.
However, in addition to this there are also a CloudWatch agent
which you can use to define your own custom metrics.
And there is also CloudWatch Logs,
which allows you to monitor operating system logs
and application logs.
And this allows you to create your own custom
application monitoring solution.
So let is take a look at how it works with EC2 for example,
and by default, all EC2 instances send key health
and performance metrics into CloudWatch,
and the default EC2 host level metrics consists of CPU,
network, disk, and status check.
And by default CloudWatch metrics are stored indefinitely
and you can even retrieve data from any EC2 instance
or Elastic Load Balancer instance
even after the instance has been terminated.
So that is the default metrics,
but what about the operating system-level metrics?
Well, by default EC2 does not send
operating system-level metrics into CloudWatch.
However, by installing the CloudWatch agent
on your EC2 instances
you can collect operating system metrics
and send them into CloudWatch.
And when I say operating system level metrics
the kind of thing I am talking about is memory usage
on your instance, processes running on your instance,
the amount of free disk space available on your instance,
and CPU idle time.
And these are all operating system-level metrics,
which you can only see inside the operating system
of your instance.
And the CloudWatch agent running on your instance
can collect these metrics and send them into CloudWatch.
And you might be wondering how much granularity
you get with CloudWatch.
How frequently are the metrics being sent?
Well by default, EC2 sends metric data
into CloudWatch in 5-minute intervals.
However, if you need more granularity than that
then for an additional charge you can enable
detailed monitoring, which sends the metrics
at 1-minute intervals.
And for custom metrics, the default is 1-minute intervals,
but you can configure high-resolution metrics
which are sent at 1-second intervals.
But just be aware when you increase the frequency
of metrics collection, you will incur additional charges.
Now, in addition to operating system metrics,
we can also use CloudWatch to monitor the contents
of system and application logs.
So you can monitor and troubleshoot your applications
using existing system and application log files.
So if any error messages or warnings
appear in your application log files
then these can be sent into CloudWatch.
And it is completely customizable for your application.
So with CloudWatch logs, you can monitor your logs in near
real time for specific phrases, values or patterns
that you define.
And as this is a customizable feature,
it requires the CloudWatch agent.
And one common use case for CloudWatch logs
is to track the number of errors that occur
in your application log and send a notification
whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold
that specify.
Onto CloudWatch alarms.
And you can create an alarm to monitor any CloudWatch metric
in your account.
And this can include EC2 CPU utilization,
Elastic Load Balancer latency
or even the estimated charges on your AWS bill.
So you can set appropriate thresholds to trigger the alarms,
and actions to be taken if an alarm state is reached.
And a popular use case is to set an alarm
which sends you a notification
or executes an Auto Scaling policy if CPU utilization
exceeds 90% on your EC2 instance for more than five minutes.
And back in the day when I was a Unix systems administrator,
supporting production systems, CPU utilization,
was the biggest cause of monitoring alerts.
And it was the main reason for getting woken up
in the middle of the night.
So what are my exam tips for CloudWatch?
Well, firstly, remember that CloudWatch
is all about monitoring the performance and health
of your systems.
Default EC2 host-level metrics include
CPU, network, disk, and status check.
And you will need to install the CloudWatch agent
for operating system level-metrics like memory usage
on your EC2 instance, processes running on your instance,
and CPU idle time.
Use CloudWatch logs to monitor and store your logs
to help you better understand your operating systems
and applications.
And you can use CloudWatch alarms to create an alarm
to monitor any CloudWatch metric in your account
and generate an alert or take some action.
For example, like sending you a notification
or executing an Auto Scaling policy.
So that is it for this lecture.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Otherwise, I will see you in the next lecture,
where we are gonna be getting our hands dirty
with CloudWatch.
Thank you.

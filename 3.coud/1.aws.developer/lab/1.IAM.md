Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html
  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) uniquely identify AWS resources. We require an ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) tags, and API calls.
